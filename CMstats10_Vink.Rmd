# A short overview 

## Imputation
For those of you who are unfamiliar with imputation:

$$\text{With imputation, some estimation procedure is used to impute (fill in)}\\
\text{each missing datum, resulting in a completed dataset that can}\\
\text{be analyzed as if the data were completely observed.}$$

We can do this once (single imputation) or multiple times (multiple imputation). 

- **With MI, each missing datum is imputed $m \geq 2$ times, resulting in $m$ completed datasets.**

Multiple imputation has some benefits over single imputation:

- it accounts for missing data uncertainty
- it accounts for parameter uncertainty
- additional adjustments to obtain valid inference are not necessary

## Iterative imputation
